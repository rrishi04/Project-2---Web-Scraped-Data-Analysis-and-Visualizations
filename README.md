# Project-2---Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations

Purpose of Study:
This project's purpose is to obtain data from a website and tell a story through graphs and trends with scraped data from our chosen database/site. We are tasked to ask ourselves 5 different analytical questions and then scrape 5 pages of our chosen website. Then we need to use pandas along with mathplotlib & seaborn to create good-looking graphs of our findings to answer the questions we had come up with. 


Questions: (I decided to use in my study)
Who has the Highest Free Throw Attempts per Game (Based on list)

Who has the Highest Minutes Played per Game (Based on list)

Who has the Highest Points per Game (Based on list)

Who has the Highest Blocks per Game (Based on list)

What are the Total Games Played by Each Player in descending order (Based on list)




Files:
